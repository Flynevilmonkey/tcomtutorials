            <h2>Preface</h2>
            <p>HMI (
                <mark class="redbold">Hydrargyrum medium-arc iodide</mark>&nbsp;) lights are a metal-halide discharge, medium arc lamp manufactured specifically for film and entertainment applications. Unlike traditional lighting units which employ incandescent bulbs, HMIs require electrical
                <mark class="redbold">ballasts</mark>, which are separated from the
                <mark class="redbold">lamp head</mark>&nbsp;via a
                <mark class="redbold">header cable</mark>, to regulate electrical current and supply the proper voltage. Where as tungsten-halogen lamps use the halide gas to regenerate their filament, the vapourized mercury combined with the halides actually emit light from HMI lamps. The color temperature is a result of specific lamp chemistries and can range from ~5400K to ~6500K dependent upon age of the bulb. During the prime of a bulb’s lifespan, the temperature usually sits between 5600K - 6000K and rapidly decay as it gets older with various bulbs decaying differently, making it difficult to match color temperature from lamp to lamp.</p>

            <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
            <p>This is a supplemental guide, and does not absolve users of liability. Users alone are responsible for safety, proper use, and damages incurred while operating aforementioned equipment.</p>

            <h2>Safe Operation of HMI Lamps</h2>

            <p>Proper operation of HMI Lamps is crucial to both utilization of the lamp and set safety.</p>

            <h3>Operation Advisement</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Ensure that ballast and lamp switches are in the
                    <mark class="redbold">‘OFF’</mark>&nbsp;position before making connections.</li>

                <li>HMIs are NOT dimmable via DMX or variac dimmer routes. Some ballasts offer a built in dimmer. DO NOT connect HMI Lamps to dimmers under ANY circumstances</li>

                <li>Ensure that lamp is placed in the
                    <mark class="redbold">FULL SPOT</mark>&nbsp;position at the beginning of the set-up phase, before rigging it to a stand, mount, condor, etc. This places the bulb as far from the shielding glass as possible as an extra precaution, should the bulb explode.</li>

                <li>
                    <mark class="redbold">NEVER</mark>&nbsp;touch the bulb of an HMI (most lamp housings are designed to make this impossible without breaking into the housing). Natural oils left on a bulb can cause the temperature of the arc to rise, causing the bulb to arc at a greater length resulting in the bulb exploding. Likewise
                    <mark class="redbold">NEVER</mark>&nbsp;touch the shielding glass of the front of a lamp.</li>

                <li>It is recommended to replace HMI bulbs once they have reached half of their life expectancy. Bulbs decay more rapidly after reaching this point, thus varying their color temperature and making them more prone to exploding.
                    <mark class="redbold">NEVER</mark>&nbsp;attempt to change a bulb yourself. TELEPLEX EQUIPMENT CHECKOUT staff will complete this task. If you believe a bulb requires a replacement please notify TELEPLEX EQUIPMENT CHECKOUT staff.</li>

                <li>Bulbs are most likely to EXPLODE during the
                    <mark class="redbold">‘CYCLING’</mark>&nbsp;phase upon being struck. Once you have struck the lamp it is recommended that all users stand away from the lamp head during the cycling phase.</li>

                <li>Exterior / Interior temperatures can drastically change the arc of the bulb and could result in explosions should the following not be adhered to:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <mark class="redbold">DO NOT</mark>&nbsp;move lamp from one temperature extreme to the other without first striking the lamp and allowing it to cool down entirely.</li>

                    <li>Moving a lamp from an environment to any environment whose temperature is +/- 10 degrees will
                        <mark class="redbold">REQUIRE</mark>&nbsp;the lamp to be struck
                        <mark class="redbold">OFF</mark>&nbsp;and allowed to cool down before being moved to the new environment.</li>

                    <li>Lamps should
                        <mark class="redbold">NEVER</mark>&nbsp;be operated in excess of 100°F or below 32°F</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

            <h2>Safe Rigging of HMI Lamps</h2>

            <p>Proper Rigging techniques should be used to ensure that lamps are secure during operation.</p>

            <h3>Rigging Advisement</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Mount all Adapting Lenses, Barndoors, Softboxes, etc.
                    <mark class="redbold">BEFORE</mark>&nbsp;striking.</li>

                <li>Make connections in a backwards pattern:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Place and rig light</li>
                    <li>Run header cable, ensuring slack is present</li>
                    <li>Place ballast in a safe environment. Make connections. Plug in.</li>
                </ul>

                <li>Ensure that the accessory mount latch is
                    <mark class="redbold">CLOSED</mark>&nbsp;after mounting accessories to the lamp.</li>

                <li>Once the lamp is rigged and connections are made, ensure that all header cables are
                    <mark class="redbold">TIED UP</mark>&nbsp;near the lamp head, to prevent ripping/breaking the connector housings if force is applied (falls, trips, yanks, etc.)</li>

                <li>Keep header cable slack and ballast extensions ‘tidy’:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <mark class="redbold">ROUTE</mark>&nbsp;cables in a straight line where possible.</li>

                    <li>Use bright gaff-tape to tape down cables once lamp is positioned.</li>

                    <li>Keep slack coiled near the ballast in a
                        <mark class="redbold">CLOCKWISE</mark>&nbsp;manner.</li>

                    <li>
                        <mark class="redbold">NEVER</mark>&nbsp;“close-line” any cables / extensions: these should always touch the ground and not hang in the air.</li>
                </ul>

                <li>
                    <mark class="redbold">DO NOT</mark>&nbsp;apply gels directly to the lamp housing. Use barndoors and C-47s (clothespins) to apply gels in a loose fashion.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Alternatively, use gel holders and C-Stands to keep the gel from touching the lamp or accessories at all.</li>
                </ul>

                <li>
                    <mark class="redbold">ALWAYS</mark>&nbsp;place
                    <mark class="redbold">SANDBAGS</mark>&nbsp;on stands first and remove them last.</li>

                <li>If rigging a lamp to a point that is not a stand, use
                    <mark class="redbold">SAFETY LINES</mark>&nbsp;to keep it from dropping.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Proper Handling of HMI Lamps</h2>

            <p>Proper handling of HMI Lamps possessed by the TELEPLEX EQUIPMENT CHECKOUT facility is described below.</p>

            <h3>Handling Advisement</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Ensure that TWO HANDS are used to CARRY larger lamps. This may require two (2) persons to rig the light.</li>

                <li>Lamps will
                    <mark class="redbold">CYCLE</mark>&nbsp;upon striking, before reaching operating capacity. Allow approximately SEVEN (7) MINUTES for this phase before the lamp is ‘hot’.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>During the
                        <mark class="redbold">CYCLING</mark>&nbsp;phase, the bulb will gradually get brighter before reaching operating capacity.</li>

                    <li>The
                        <mark class="redbold">LAMP</mark>&nbsp;and
                        <mark class="redbold">BALLAST</mark>&nbsp;may make a higher-pitched noise during the
                        <mark class="redbold">CYCLING</mark>&nbsp;phase, which will gradually subside to normal decibel levels when complete.</li>
                </ul>

                <li>HMI lamps are NOT “Hot Strike” fixtures. You MUST allow approximately TWENTY (20) MINUTES for the lamp to cool off, before striking it back on.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Attempting to immediately strike the lamp back on (Hot Striking) after striking off, can increase the chance of the bulb EXPLODING.</li>

                    <li>Attempting to immediately strike the lamp back on after striking off, can increase the chance of overloading the <mark class="redbold">BALLAST</mark>.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>HMI lamps are NOT to be operated in inclement weather.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><mark class="redbold">LAMP</mark>&nbsp; housings and <mark class="redbold">BALLASTS</mark>&nbsp; are NOT water resistant.</li>
                </ul>

                <li><mark class="redbold">LAMP</mark>&nbsp; housing can become EXTREMELY hot when at operational capacity.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>DO NOT touch the housing with bare hands</li>

                    <li>DO NOT attach GELS directly to the housing, safety glass, or bulb.</li>

                    <li>DO NOT cover ventilation areas of the housing with blackwrap/cinefoil.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>



            <h2>Wattage Output / General Electrics</h2>

            <p>Basic understanding of wattage output and electrics is required to operate HMIs.</p>

            <h3>Electric Advisement</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>HMI Lamps are rated based on operational wattage output.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wattage Output may be found on either the <mark class="redbold">LAMP</mark>&nbsp; or <mark class="redbold">BALLAST</mark>.</li>

                    <li>Wattage Output is directly proportionate to the size of the lamps.</li>

                    <li>EXAMPLE: 200W - Small Lamp | 18Kw - Large Lamp</li>
                </ul>
                <li>During the <mark class="redbold">CYCLING</mark>&nbsp; phase an HMI lamp will pull more amps, thus increasing it’s Wattage Output. After <mark class="redbold">CYCLING</mark>&nbsp; the lamp will reach normal Wattage Output.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>It is possible to overload a circuit during the CYCLING phase because of IGNITION AMPERAGE vs OPERATION AMPERAGE.</li>

                    <li>DO NOT strike multiple HMI lamps on the same CIRCUIT. Strike them separately and allow each lamp to go through the <mark class="redbold">CYCLING</mark>&nbsp; phase individually.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><mark class="redbold">BALLASTS</mark>&nbsp; MUST ALWAYS be on GROUNDED CIRCUITS.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>NEVER utilize <mark class="redbold">2-to-3 Prong Lifts</mark>&nbsp; with HMI <mark class="redbold">BALLASTS</mark>.</li>

                    <li>Failure to follow this advisement may result in the <mark class="redbold">BALLAST</mark>&nbsp; overloading or BULB exploding.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>NEVER use <mark class="redbold">STINGERS</mark>&nbsp; (Extension Cords) that are rated ABOVE 12-GAUGE.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><mark class="redbold">STINGER</mark>&nbsp; Gauges are rated from the lowest number being ‘stronger’ to the highest number being ‘weaker’.</li>

                    <li><mark class="redbold">STINGERS</mark>&nbsp; rated under 12-GAUGE (i.e. the number is higher than twelve - 13, 14, etc.) are not capable of handling the electrical load of HMI <mark class="redbold">LAMPS</mark>&nbsp; and <mark class="redbold">BALLASTS</mark>.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
